<<  Comosite Design Pattern  >>
------------------------------------------------
- Structural Design Pattern

- Hierarchical representations of objects are required.
- A single object and a group of objects should be treated in the same way.
- The Composite pattern is used when data is organized in a tree structure (for example directories in a computer).


- Component - interface
- Component object - Component with children
- Leaf object
